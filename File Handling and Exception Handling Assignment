1. File Read & Write Challenge 

# Function to read from a file, modify the content, and write to a new file
def modify_file(input_filename, output_filename):
    try:
        # Open the input file in read mode
        with open(input_filename, 'r') as infile:
            # Read the contents of the file
            content = infile.read()

        # Modify the content (example: converting to uppercase)
        modified_content = content.upper()

        # Open the output file in write mode
        with open(output_filename, 'w') as outfile:
            # Write the modified content to the new file
            outfile.write(modified_content)

        print(f"File modified and saved as {output_filename}.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{input_filename}' was not found.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: Could not read or write the file.")

2. Error Handling Lab 

# Function to ask for a filename and handle errors
def read_file_with_error_handling():
    filename = input("Please enter the filename to read: ")

    try:
        # Attempt to open and read the file
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            print(f"Content of the file:\n{content}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: Could not read the file '{filename}'.")

# Call the error handling function
read_file_with_error_handling()
